      <!-- editor's note: Section 1.1 replaced with boilerplate text from other recent modules. Original materials integrated here and also moved down to section 1.3 -->
      The scope of the PP-Module for Email Clients, Version 1.1 is to describe the security functionality of email client applications in terms of [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for the specific email-related capabilities of email client applications.
      Email clients are user applications that provide functionality to send, receive, access, and manage email. 
      
      This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP: <h:ul>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software, Version 2.0</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:p/> This Base-PP is valid because email clients are a specific type of software application.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      
      The Target of Evaluation  (TOE) in this PP-Module is an email client application running on a desktop or mobile operating system. 
      <h:p/>
      The complexity of email content and email clients has grown over time.
      Modern email clients can render HTML as well as plaintext,
      and may include functionality to display common attachment formats, such as Adobe PDF and  Microsoft Word documents.
      Some email clients allow their functionality to be modified by users through the addition of add-ons.
      Protocols have also been defined for communicating between email clients and servers.
      Some clients support multiple protocols for doing the same task,
      allowing them to be configured according to email server specifications.
      <h:p/>
      The complexity
      and rich feature set of modern email clients make them a target for attackers, which introduces
      security concerns. This document is intended to facilitate the improvement of email client
      security by requiring use of operating system security services, cryptographic standards, and
      environmental mitigations. Additionally, the requirements in this document define acceptable
      behavior for email clients regardless of the security features provided by the operating
      system.
      <h:p/>
      This Module along with the Protection Profile for Application
      Software <xref to="bibAppPP"/> provides a baseline set of Security Functional
      Requirements (SFRs) for email clients running on any operating system regardless of the
      composition of the underlying platform.
      
      
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The physical boundary of the email client is a software application running on a general-purpose operating system. The TOE boundary may include third-party add-ons, but these are non-interfering with respect to security;
        add-ons provide features that are outside the TOE's logical boundary but must be implemented in such a manner that their inclusion does not compromise the security of the TSF. The figure below shows the TOE's interaction with
        remote external interfaces that are used to transfer mail between clients. Two separate email clients are shown to show how the TOE can function as both a sender and a receiver using different protocols.

  <sec:spd title="Security Problem Description">
      The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the email client is expected to address, assumptions about the operational environment, 
      and any organizational security policies that it is expected to enforce.
    <sec:Threats> The following threat is specific to email
    clients, and represents an addition to those identified in the Base-PP.
    <threats>
      <threat name="T.FLAWED_ADDON">
	<description> Email client functionality can be extended with integration of third-party
	utilities and tools. This expanded set of capabilities is made possible via the use of
	add-ons. The tight integration between the basic email client code and the new
	capabilities that add-ons provide increases the risk that malefactors could inject
	serious flaws into the email client application, either maliciously by an attacker, or
	accidentally by a developer. These flaws enable undesirable behaviors including, but not
	limited to, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information in the email client,
	unauthorized access to the device's file system, or even privilege escalation that
	enables unauthorized access to other applications or the operating system.
	</description>
	<consistency-rationale>
	  The threat of a user installing a flawed add-on is consistent with the T.LOCAL_ATTACK threat from the Base-PP. A flawed add-on, crafted deliberately or unintentionally, could cause the product to operate in a manner where it

      <con-toe>
        If this PP-Module is used to extend the App PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a software application.
        The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the email client functionality that is built into the application so that additional security functionality is claimed within the scope of the TOE.
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        The only asset for the TOE is the software executable and sensitive data that comprises the TOE. The entire TOE as defined by the combination of the
        Base-PP and this PP-Module is a single asset. The only difference to the threat model is that the PP-Module introduces the concept of add-ons, which
        introduces the threat of an add-on being flawed in some way.
      </con-toe>
      
      <con-sec-prob>
        Listed below are the threats, objectives, and OSPs defined in this PP-Module with rationale for their consistency with the App PP.
        Note that the PP-Module is implicitly consistent with any claimed functional packages because the applicable functional packages do not have
        security problem definitions of their own; per section 2, any claimed functional package is intended to support the O.PROTECTED_COMMS objective in the
        App PP, which helps mitigate the T.NETWORK_ATTACK and T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP threats in that PP. 
      </con-sec-prob>
      <con-obj>
        Listed below are the security objectives defined in this PP-Module with rationale for their consistency with the App PP. The PP-Module shares the
        executable application asset with the App PP but defines additional security objectives because the PP-Module defines a specific type of software application
        with security functionality that is common to the application type.
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        Note that the PP-Module is implicitly consistent with any claimed functional packages because the applicable functional packages do not have
        TOE objecitves of their own; per section 2, any claimed functional package is intended to support the O.PROTECTED_COMMS objective in the
        App PP.

		  For these management functions, the term "Administrator" refers
		  to the administrator of a non-mobile device or the device owner of a mobile device.
		  The Administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting the
		  policy that is applied by the enterprise on the email client. The Administrator could
		  be acting remotely and could be the mail transfer agent (MTA) administrator acting through a centralized
		  management console or dashboard. Applications used to configure enterprise policy
		  should have their own identification and authorization and additional security
		  requirements to ensure that the remote administration is trusted.
		  <h:p/>
		  The intent of
		  this requirement is to allow the Administrator to configure the email client with a
		  policy that may not be over-ridden by the user. If the Administrator has not set a
		  policy for a particular function, the user may still perform that function.
		  Enforcement of the policy is done by the email client itself, or the email client and
		  the email client platform in coordination with each other.
	        <h:p/>
		  The function to
		  configure whether to establish a trusted channel corresponds to the functionality
		  described in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2 (from the Base-PP). The Administrator has the
		  option of accepting or rejecting all certificates that cannot be validated, accepting
		  a given certificate that cannot be validated, or not accepting a given certificate
		  that cannot be validated. Depending on the choice that the Administrator has made in
		  FIA_X509_EXT.2.2 (from the Base-PP), the trusted connection will either be
		  allowed for all certificates that cannot be validated, disallowed for all certificates
		  that cannot be validated, allowed for a given certificate that cannot be validated, or
		  disallowed for a given certificate that cannot be validated. 
	        <h:p/>
		  If password or
		  passphrase authorization factors are implemented by the email client, then the
		  appropriate "change" selection must be included. 
	        <h:p/>
		  If the email client provides
		  configurability of the cryptographic functions (for example, key size), then "configure cryptographic
		  functionality" will be included, and the specifics of the functionality offered can
		  either be written in this requirement as bullet points, or included in the TSS. This applies even if the configuration is in the form of parameters that may be passed to cryptographic functionality implemented on the TOE platform.
	        <h:p/>
		  If the email client does include a key recovery function, the
		  email client must provide the capability for the user to turn this functionality off
		  so that no recovery key is generated and no keys are permitted to be exported.
		
	      </note>
	      <aactivity>
		The evaluation activities for this component will be driven by the selections made by the ST author. If a capability is not selected in the ST, the noted evaluation activity does not need to be performed. 
		<TSS>
		  The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes those management functions which may only be configured by the email client platform administrator and cannot be overridden by the user when set according to policy.<h:p/>
		  Change Password: The evaluator shall examine the Operational Guidance to ensure that it describes how the password/passphrase-based authorization factor is to be changed.<h:p/>
		  Disable Key Recovery: If the email client supports key recovery, this must be stated in the TSS. The TSS shall also describe how to disable this functionality. This includes a description of how the recovery material is provided to the recovery holder.<h:p/>
		  Cryptographic Configuration: The evaluator shall determine from the TSS for other requirements (FCS_*) what portions of the cryptographic functionality are configurable.<h:p/>

		<Guidance>
		The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify that it includes instructions for an email client platform administrator to configure the functions listed in FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1.<h:p/>

		  Cryptographic Configuration: The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to determine that there are instructions for manipulating all of the claimed mechanisms.<h:p/>

              <TSS>
                For FCS_CKM_EXT.5.1, there are two aspects of this component that require evaluation: passwords/passphrases of the length specified in the requirement (at least 64 characters) are supported, 
                and that the characters that are input are subject to the selected conditioning function. These activities are separately addressed in the text below.
                <h:p/>
                Support for Password/Passphrase length: The evaluator shall check to ensure that the TSS describes the allowable ranges for password/passphrase lengths, and that at least 64 characters may be specified by the user.
                <h:p/>
                Support for PBKDF: The evaluator shall examine the password hierarchy TSS to ensure that the formation of all keys is described and that the key sizes match that described by the ST author.
                <h:p/>
                The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the method by which the password/passphrase is first encoded and then fed to the SHA algorithm. 
                The settings for the algorithm (padding, blocking, etc.) shall be described, and the evaluator shall verify that these are supported by the selections in this component as well as the selections concerning the hash function itself. 
                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS contains a description of how the output of the hash function is used to form the submask that will be input into the function and is the same length as the KEK as specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.4.
                <h:p/>
                For the NIST SP 800-132-based conditioning of the password/passphrase, the required assurance activities will be performed when doing the assurance activities for the appropriate requirements (FCS_COP.1.1(4) from the [AppPP]). 
                If any manipulation of the key is performed in forming the submask that will be used to form the file encryption key or key encryption key, that process shall be described in the TSS. 
                For the claimed iteration count, the evaluator shall verify that the iteration count for PBKDFs performed by the TOE comply with NIST SP 800-132 by ensuring that the TSS contains a description of the estimated time required 
                to derive key material from passwords and how the TOE increases the computation time for password-based key derivation (including but not limited to increasing the iteration count).
                <h:p/>
              </TSS>
              <Guidance>
                The evaluator shall check the operational guidance to determine that there are instructions on how to generate large passwords/passphrases, 
                and instructions on how to configure the password/passphrase length (and optional complexity settings) to provide entropy commensurate with the keys that the authorization factor is protecting. 
                This is important because many default settings for passwords/passphrases will not meet the necessary entropy needed as specified in this PP-Module
                <h:p/>
              </Guidance>
              <Tests>The evaluator shall compose passwords that either meet the requirements, or fail to meet the requirements, 
                and shall verify that the TOE's behavior is consistent with the requirements. 
                While the evaluator is not required (nor is it feasible) to test all possible compositions of passwords, 
                the evaluator shall ensure that all characters, and minimum and maximum lengths listed in the requirement, are supported, and justify the subset of those characters chosen for testing.
                <h:p/>
                Support for Password/Passphrase characteristics: In addition to the analysis above, the evaluator shall also perform the following tests on a TOE configured according to the Operational Guidance
                <testlist>
                  <test>The evaluator shall ensure that the TOE supports passwords/passphrases of exactly 64 characters.</test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall ensure that the TOE does not accept more than the maximum number of characters specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.5.1.</test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall ensure that the TOE does not accept less than the minimum number of characters specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.5.4. 
                    If the minimum length is settable by the administrator, the evaluator determines the minimum length or lengths to test.</test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall ensure that the TOE supports passwords consisting of all characters listed in FCS_CKM_EXT.5.2 and of varying lengths within the range specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.5.4.</test>
                </testlist>
                No explicit testing of the formation of the submask from the input password is required.
                <h:p/>
                For password conditioning, no explicit testing of the formation of the authorization factor from the input password/passphrase is required.
